This project explores a data-driven scouting methodology to identify **Sub-23 attacking players** who combine **strong performance** with **relatively low market value**, using advanced football metrics derived from Wyscout data for the **2020/21 season**.

## Objectives
- Rank U23 attackers using a transparent **performance + value scoring model**
- Identify **undervalued players** relative to their on-field contribution
- Use **clustering** to compare players within similar offensive profiles

## Project Structure
- `notebooks/` — main Jupyter notebook with the full analysis  
- `assets/` — images and visual assets used in the project  

## Data Source
- Engineered Wyscout dataset by **Edd Webster** (public GitHub repository).  
  This is an exploratory analysis and the data may contain minor imprecisions inherent to aggregated football datasets.
